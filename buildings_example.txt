# Lines with "#" as their first character, are comments
# Example building:
#-1.0 3.0 2.0 10.0 0.0 9.0
# Makes a box with corners at (-1.0, 2.0, 0.0) and (3.0, 10.0, 9.0).
# So 2 units wide, 8 units long, and 9 units high
# Currently, buildings are concrete blocks, without rooms inside
# Note that nodes can be inside solid walls, affecting their connectivity.
